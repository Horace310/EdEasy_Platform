Extracting the zip, there will be two java files.
Compile server.java and run it on the terminal. Leave that terminal running and open another terminal.
Compile and run board.java.
A drawing board would open.

You can open as many boards as you want. Just run the board on different terminals and each will spawn a new board.

Any drawing done on one board will be reflected on all other drawing boards.
