Extract the files.
Create a database and name it weblib. (Changes in the database name would mean having to change the database names in the codes as well.  Hence any other name for the database would not work without changing the names in the codes.)
Import the sql file.

Run the weblib on localhost or any other hosting. For admin account credentials, check the login table on the sql database.
